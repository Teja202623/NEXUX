## 1. Product Overview  

LocalRankAI is an **AI-driven Local SEO SaaS** designed for Australian SMBs and digital agencies. It combines automated rank tracking, citation audits, competitor analysis, and predictive modelling to help businesses **improve local visibility faster**.  

Unlike legacy tools such as BrightLocal or Localo, LocalRankAI integrates **automation-first workflows**, **AI-generated Smart Tasks**, and **predictive outcome modelling**, giving users actionable next steps and measurable business impact rather than just static reports.

The goal is to build the **most comprehensive local SEO intelligence and execution platform** in the Australian market — offering predictive insights, real-time automation, and a single control hub for rankings, citations, reviews, and Google Business Profile performance.

- Audits and maintains consistent directory citations (NAP).
