## KEY PRINCIPLE: DO THE WORK

**This plan works IF AND ONLY IF you execute.**

The biggest mistake: Over-planning, under-executing.

**Phase 1 is simple because it has to be:**
- No time for perfection
- No time for overthinking
- Just send emails + make calls + close deals

Once you've done that 10 times, then you can automate.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I skip Phase 1 and go straight to Phase 2?**
A: No. Phase 1 validates that the business works. If you skip it, you might automate the wrong thing.

**Q: What if I only get 5 customers in Phase 1?**
A: Still move to Phase 2. You've proven PMF. You'll scale faster with automation.

**Q: Can I parallelize Phase 1 + Phase 2?**
A: No. Phase 1 must complete first. You learn what works, then automate it.

**Q: How much time per week do I need?**
A: Phase 1: 10-15 hours/week. Phase 2: 5-10 hours/week. Phase 3: 2-5 hours/week.

**Q: What if plumbers don't buy?**
A: You'll know by Week 2. Then you pivot (change message, change niche, change location). But don't pivot too early. Give it 2-3 weeks minimum.

**Q: Can I use this for other niches?**
A: Yes. Same playbook works for any trade: Electrical, HVAC, Locksmith, Plumbing, etc.
