## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

### Phase 1: Send Consistently
- Don't wait for replies to send more
- Email is a numbers game
- 5-8% reply rate is normal and good
- Make calls when replies come in

### Phase 2: Research Efficiently
- Don't aim for perfection
- "Good enough" data is fine
- Focus on quality prospects (30+ reviews, 4.5+ rating)
- Speed > perfection

### Parallel Execution
- Morning = emails only (1-2 hours)
- Day job = ignore both projects
- Evening = calls (1 hour) + research (3-4 hours)
- Total: 20-25 hours/week is sustainable

---

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS & SOLUTIONS

### "I don't have time for both"
→ Solution: Morning = Phase 1, Evening = Phase 2 (separate times)

### "Emails aren't getting replies"
→ Solution: That's normal. 5-8% is good. Keep sending. Calls close deals, not emails.

### "Research is taking too long"
→ Solution: 2 hours per 100 prospects is target. If slower, skip non-essential data.

### "I'm not closing customers on calls"
→ Solution: Use PHASE-1-DISCOVERY-SCRIPT.md exactly. Practice. It gets better.

### "I want to build the system now"
→ Solution: Don't. Phase 2 weeks 3-4 start the build. This week = research only.
