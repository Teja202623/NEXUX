- ❌ Content automation (Phase 1 is manual)
- ❌ Social media posting (Phase 1 is sales-focused)
- ❌ Video generation (skip Phase 1)

## Your Starting Point

**You are here:** ← Phase 1 Ready to Start

**Next:** Open `PHASE-1-MVP-EXECUTION.md` and follow Day 1

---

## Key Principles

1. **Phase 1 is manual.** No automation. Just you selling.
2. **Don't skip phases.** Each builds on the previous one.
3. **Execution > Planning.** You've planned enough. Time to execute.
4. **Follow the playbook.** Day 1-5, Week 1-4. No deviations.
5. **Document what works.** Phase 1 feeds Phase 2. Phase 2 feeds Phase 3.

---

## Your Commitment

**Phase 1 requires:**
- 50 hours over 4 weeks (12-15 hours/week)
- Consistent daily execution (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri)
- Documentation of what works
- 100% focus on sales (no building)

**If you give Phase 1 full commitment, you will have:**
- 10 customers ($2,000/month)
- Proof it works
- Playbook for Phase 2
- Case studies to sell more

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I start Phase 2 before Phase 1 is done?**
A: Not recommended. Finish Phase 1 first (4 weeks), then start Phase 2 in Week 5.

**Q: What if I don't get 10 customers by Week 4?**
A: If you have 5+, move to Phase 2 anyway. Automation helps. If you have <5, assess what's wrong (script? market? niche?) and adjust.

**Q: Can I do this part-time?**
A: Yes. Phase 1 is 12-15 hours/week. Phase 2 is 5-10 hours/week. Phase 3 is 2-5 hours/week.

**Q: Can I use this for other niches?**
A: Yes. Same playbook. Just change "plumbing" to "electrician" or "locksmith" and repeat.

**Q: Do I need a team for Phase 1?**
A: No. Phase 1 is just you. Teams come in Phase 3.
