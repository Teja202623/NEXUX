## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### For Phase 1 Success
1. **Send emails consistently** (4-5 per day, 20-25/week)
2. **Follow up quickly** (reply within 1 hour if possible)
3. **Make the calls** (don't skip, this is where closes happen)
4. **Document wins** (save winning email, script, customer profile)

### For Phase 2 Success
1. **Finish database setup Week 1-2** (everything depends on this)
2. **One feature per week** (don't try to build everything at once)
3. **Test with 10 prospects first** (catch bugs early)
4. **Export clean data** (bad data in = bad posts out)
5. **Schedule posts early** (by Week 11, not last minute)

### For Parallel Success
1. **Time block ruthlessly** (morning = emails, evening = coding)
2. **Don't let Phase 1 distract from Phase 2 setup** (Weeks 1-2 are critical)
3. **Automate Phase 2 as much as possible** (run CLI commands, not manual work)
4. **Monitor energy levels** (this is intense - 16-25 hrs/week for 12 weeks)

---

## WHAT IF YOU GET STUCK?

**If Phase 1 is taking more time than expected:**
- Reduce Phase 2 effort that week
- Still do database setup (Weeks 1-2)
- Still do CLI building (Weeks 3-4)
- Scale back testing/experimentation

**If Phase 2 building hits delays:**
- Don't delay Phase 1 (emails are revenue)
- Continue cold email as priority
- Phase 2 can slip by 1-2 weeks
- Make up time in Weeks 9-10 when it's automated

**If you can't generate 10-15 customers in Phase 1:**
- That's okay - you might get 7-10
- Focus on learning what works
- Use fewer, higher-quality prospects
- Continue into Week 5+ until you hit 10

**If you can't hit 150 posts:**
- 100 posts is still valuable
- Quality > quantity for content
- You can generate more in Phase 3

---

## YOU'VE GOT THIS

This is aggressive but achievable:

✅ You have all the templates (emails, scripts, CTAs)
✅ You have all the documentation (PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
✅ You have the architecture (5 Prisma models ready to add)
✅ You have the tool stack (everything is free/low-cost)
✅ You have 12 weeks (plenty of time)

**The only variable is YOUR execution.**

One week at a time. One email at a time. One code commit at a time.

By Week 12, you'll have:
- 10-15 paying customers
- 150+ posts building authority
- $2,000-3,000 MRR
- Foundation for $20,000+ MRR in 6 months

---

1. ✅ Add 5 Prisma models to schema
2. ✅ Run migration
3. ✅ Start prospect research (340 total)
