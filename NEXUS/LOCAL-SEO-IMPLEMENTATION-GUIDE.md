## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Posting Inconsistently
**Problem**: Post heavily for 2 weeks, then stop
**Solution**: Create 4 weeks of content in advance, schedule it
**Tool**: Meta Scheduling (built into Ads Manager)

### ❌ Using Salesy Captions
**Problem**: "BUY NOW" in every post
**Solution**: 80% educational, 20% promotional
**Rule**: If 5 posts in a row, only last one has CTA

### ❌ Not Engaging with Audience
**Problem**: Post and disappear
**Solution**: Reply to every comment within 24 hours
**Time**: 5 minutes per post = 20 min/week

### ❌ Ignoring Ad Data
**Problem**: Let bad ads run for weeks
**Solution**: Check daily, pause underperformers after 3 days
**Rule**: Don't let any ad run more than 7 days without review

### ❌ Wrong Audience Targeting
**Problem**: Ads shown to teenagers, not business owners
**Solution**: Test audience carefully, use custom audiences
**Test**: Run $50 test campaign before scaling

### ❌ Not Differentiating from Competitors
**Problem**: Similar messaging to Rank By Monday
**Solution**: Focus on "Local SEO Specialist" (not just SEO)
**Angle**: "Small business focus" (not enterprise)

### ❌ Expecting Instant Results
**Problem**: Give up after 2 weeks
**Solution**: Commit 90 days minimum for real data
**Reality**: Month 1 is reach, Month 2 is engagement, Month 3 is leads
